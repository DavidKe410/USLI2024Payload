#NASA Student Launch Competition - University Division 2024-2025

The Blue Horizon club at USAFA created a rocket-deployed quadcopter to compete in the competition to land a human-survivable lander in a specific orientation. A standard 4" fiberglass, dual-deployed rocket was the flight vehicle. Drogue deployment at apogee of around 5200'. Main deployment occurred around 1000' AGL. The tether lengths were sized so that the nosecone would hang lower than any other portion, giving an unobstructed view of the ground after main separation. At this time, the ground station would provide a command to arm the flight controller and deploy the 4 quadcopter arms. After locking the arms in place, another command was sent to completely separate the drone-payload from the rocket. A pilot on the ground, using the transmitted video feed, would fly the payload to the ground using FPV goggles and a standard long-range RC controller. The drone-payload would then successfully land on the 4 legs that were deployed along with the 4 arms.

 This is the code for the ground station activation of the flight controller, lowering of the legs, and separation from the rocket. 
 
 The flight code for the Teensy 4.1 onboard the payload is also included.

 This was all coded through the Arduino interface. All systems were functional and successful.

 Our system was one of the very few teams - out of around 50 in-person - to test and deploy our payload system at NASA's culmination event. Earning us the Service Academy Award.
